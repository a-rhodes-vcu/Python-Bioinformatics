1)Given  DNA sequence using command-line parameter, calculate GC Content of the sequence. GC Content = Percentage of G and C in the sequence. Please keep in the mind that  dna sequence can have Upper or Lower or both cases(2) 


import sys


if len(sys.argv) < 2:
    print"USAGE: python %s dna-sequence" % (sys.argv[0])
    sys.exit()


dna = sys.argv[1]
dnacount = 0
length = len(dna)
for nue in dna:
   if nue == 'G' or nue == 'C' or nue == 'g' or nue == 'c':
      dnacount += 1
      y = dnacount * 100/length




print "DNA Length = %d " % (length)
print "Number of G's and C's = %d " % (dnacount)
print "Percentange of G's of C's = %d%% " % (y)
















2)Please write a program to bin  N random numbers between 0 and 100 into three groups. Please accept a numerical value of N from command-line. Please generate below output :  (2 points)    


import sys
import random


if len(sys.argv)<2:
    print "USAGE: python %s dna-sequence" % (sys.argv[0])
    sys.exit()


RandomNumber = int(sys.argv[1])
a = 0
b = 0
c = 0
count = 0
sum=0
for counter in range(RandomNumber):
    R=random.randint(0,100)
    sum += R
    if R <= 33:
        count +=1
        a +=1
    elif R > 33 and R <=66:
        b+= 1
        count += 1
    elif R > 66:
        c+=1
        count +=1
print " "
avg = sum/float(RandomNumber)
print "Number of computer generated random numbers=  %d " %(count)
print "Number of random-generated  numbers =                %f" %(avg)
print "Count of numbers less than 33=                                %d  " % (a)
print "Count of numbers between 33 and 66=                     %d  " % (b)
print "Count of numbers greater than 66=                           %d  "% (c)














3) Please write a program to count/calculate how many different ways one can get exactly N numbers of coin heads out of M coin flips. (Count no of different ways to get exactly 3 heads out of 5 coin flips. ).  Please accept values of N and M using command-line parameters. Please print number of different ways in output. N and M are integer numbers. (1 point)


import sys
import math


if len(sys.argv) < 3:
    print "USAGE: python %s dna-sequence"% (sys.argv[0])
    sys.exit()


N = int(sys.argv[1])
M = int(sys.argv[2])


y = (math.factorial(M))/((math.factorial(M-N))*math.factorial(N))


print "Number of exact heads =  %d "% (N)
print "Number of Exact Flips =    %d"%(M)
print "Total Different Ways  =     %d"%(y)
